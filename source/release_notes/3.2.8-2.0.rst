====================================
Percona Server for MongoDB 3.2.8-2.0
====================================

Percona is glad to announce the release of
Percona Server for MongoDB 3.2.8-2.0 on August 11, 2016
Downloads are available
`here <https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-3.2>`_
and from the :ref:`Percona Software Repositories <install>`.

Percona Server for MongoDB is a highly scalable,
zero-maintenance downtime database
supporting the MongoDB v3.2 protocol and drivers.
It extends MongoDB with `MongoRocks <http://rocksdb.org>`_,
:ref:`inmemory`, and :ref:`PerconaFT <perconaft>` storage engines,
as well as several enterprise features.
Percona Server for MongoDB requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

.. note:: The PerconaFT storage engine has been deprecated
   and will not be available in future releases.

This release is based on `MongoDB 3.2.8
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.2/#jul-12-2016>`_,
and includes the following additional changes:

**New Features**

* Introducing the new :ref:`inmemory`,
  which is based on a special configuration of WiredTiger
  that stores data in memory instead of the disk.

* The MongoRocks engine now supports
  `LZ4 compression <http://cyan4973.github.io/lz4/>`_.
  This is an upstream feature of MongoRocks contributed by Percona.

  To enable it, use the ``--rocksdbCompression`` option
  when running |PSMDB| with the MongoRocks storage engine.
  For example:

  .. prompt:: bash

     ./mongod --dbpath=./data --storageEngine=rocksdb --rocksdbCompression=lz4

  For a high-compression variant of LZ4:

  .. prompt:: bash

     ./mongod --dbpath=./data --storageEngine=rocksdb --rocksdbCompression=lz4hc

  .. note:: If you want to configure this permanently,
     set the following parameters in the :file:`/etc/mongod.conf` file:

     .. code-block:: none

        storage:
          engine: rocksdb
          rocksdb:
            compression: lz4
