Percona Server for MongoDB is a highly scalable, zero-maintenance downtime database supporting the MongoDB v3.0 protocol and drivers. It is based on `MongoDB 3.0.5 <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.0/#july-28-2015>`_, extending MongoDB with `MongoRocks <http://rocksdb.org>`_ and :ref:`PerconaFT <perconaft>` storage engines, as well as several enterprise features. Percona Server for MongoDB requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

New Features
============

* :ref:`Auditing <audit-log>` enables administrators to track and log user activity on a server. The server generates an audit log file with information about various user events, including authentication, authorization failures, and so on.

* :ref:`External authentication <ext-auth>` enables the MongoDB server to verify the client's user name and password against a separate (external) service, such as OpenLDAP or Active Directory.
