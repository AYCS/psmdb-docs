====================================

Percona is glad to announce the release of Percona Server for MongoDB on September 21, 2015. Downloads are available `here <https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-for-mongodb>`_ and from the :ref:`Percona Software Repositories <installation>`.

Percona Server for MongoDB is a highly scalable, zero-maintenance downtime database supporting the MongoDB v3.0 protocol and drivers. It is based on `MongoDB 3.0.5 <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.0/#july-28-2015>`_, extending MongoDB with RocksDB and PerconaFT storage engines, as well as features like external authentication and audit logging. Percona Server for MongoDB requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

New Features
============

* :ref:`Auditing <auditing>` enables administrators to track and log user activity on a server. The server generates an audit log file with information about various user events, including authentication, authorization failures, and so on.

* :ref:`External authentication <ext-auth>` enables the MongoDB server to verify the client's user name and password against a separate (external) service, such as OpenLDAP or Active Directory.
