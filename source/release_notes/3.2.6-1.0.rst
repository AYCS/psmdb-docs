Percona Server for MongoDB is a highly scalable,

The latest release is based on
`MongoDB 3.2.6
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.2/#apr-28-2016>`_,
extending MongoDB with `MongoRocks <http://rocksdb.org>`_
and :ref:`PerconaFT <perconaft>` storage engines,
as well as several enterprise features.
Percona Server for MongoDB requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

.. note:: The PerconaFT storage engine has been deprecated
   and will not be available in future releases.

This release includes all changes from
`MongoDB 3.2.6
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.2/#apr-28-2016>`_,
as well as the following:

* PerconaFT has been deprecated.
  It is still available, but is no longer recommended for production use.
  PerconaFT will be removed in future releases.

* MongoRocks is no longer considered experimental
  and is now recommended for production.

.. note:: As of version 3.2, MongoDB uses WiredTiger
   as the default storage engine, instead of MMAPv1.
